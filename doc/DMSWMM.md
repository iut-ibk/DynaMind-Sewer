[List of Sewer Modules](Sewer.md)

#DMSWMM

The model exports a combined sewer or drainage network into a SWMM 5.0 input file, assesses the performance by running SWMM 5.0 and inports the results back into DynaMind.

##Parameter
|        Name       |          Type          |       Description         | 
|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Folder   | string | defines the working directory. The module creates for every SMM simulation a new unique folder in the working directory.       |
| RainFile   | filename | select rain file you want to use in the simulation. This parameter is optional.|
| ClimateChangeFactor   | double | the climate change factor is multiplied with the rainfall intensities of the rain|
| use euler   | bool | instead of rain file a synthetic euler rain is used|
| return period   | double | defines the return period of the euler rain|
| combined sewer system  | bool | true for combined sewer systems, false for drainage networks|
| use_linear_cf | bool | true if the module is used in group the climate change factor is increased linear |
| writeResultFile| bool | writes a result files in the working directory |
| climateChangeFactorFromCity| bool | use the climate change factor defined in the CITY component |
|  calculationTimestep| int | if the module is used in a loop, the parameter defines how often a swmm simulation is executed. e.g. a calculationTimestep of 5 means that every 5 steps swmm is executed |
|  consider_build_time| bool | if true only pipes the exist in the current simulation year defined by the attribute year of the CITY component are used in the assessment |
