#InfiltrationTrench

The module auto designs and connects the infiltration system with the catchment. The infirlation systems are designed following the german guideline DWA-A 13. The used equations can be found [here (in german)](http://www.abwdat.de/abw/versickerung/pdf/Regenwasserversickerung_Planung-Dimensionierung.pdf)
